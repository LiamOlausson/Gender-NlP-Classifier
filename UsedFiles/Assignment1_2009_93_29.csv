mara,ha,female
shelly,Got it. How did your discussion lead go?,female

shelly,Cool.,female
shelly,You running the show today vincent?,female
vincent,not that I know of.,male
mara,morning!,female
shelly,"LOL. But you could be wrong, eh?",female
vincent,"could be, but I didn't get any email about it.  I am confused, though, it's only 8:30am out here.",male
shelly,"Wow, crack o'",female
shelly,dawn.,female
vincent,"but I'm back home in seattle, so the internet works in my bed!",male
mara,thats amazing,female
mara,i have to use one the school computers cuz this program doesnt work on the MAC computer that I have,female
vincent,ouch.,male
mara,yeah but it was pretty nice of them to loan me a laptop! ha,female
vincent,that's very cool.,male
mara,hi ariel... you leading?,female
vincent,hey ariel.,male
vincent,"hm, so no one asked any of us?",male
vincent,there's always more people signed up than actually show up.,male
mara,nope maybe its time that someone just poses a topic,female
mara,yeah and i have to leave early i have a meeting at 1pm,female
vincent,ah.,male
vincent,do you guys have an Albany Craigslist?,male
mara,yes sir! love it!,female
vincent,"awesome.  I just took a trip from Seattle to Oakland to visit my girlfriend... I used the rideshare, and got down there and back (14 hour drive), for $20!!",male
mara,wow thats nice,female
mara,"im going to NC soon, remember? and I think its like a 12 hour drive",female
vincent,"super lucky.  I've used it a bunch before, but this was the luckiest one.",male
vincent,"yeah, are you driving to NC?",male
mara,yup,female
vincent,"you should try to find some riders on there, it would make gas super cheap, and it makes the drive pretty interesting.",male
mara,well i have one girl coming with me and im afraid since we are staying for a week there may no be a lot of room haha,female
vincent,that makes sense.,male
mara,theres this website where they predict your gas prices and i used it and they said around $60 to get there,female
vincent,that's not too crazy.,male
vincent,"my trip down ended up being free, the guy just wanted company.  it was with a Christian video game programmer, and a juggler from the circus.",male
mara,not if we split it i guess,female
mara,OMG that must have been interesting! haha,female
vincent,"yeah!  then the trip back up was with a spanish teacher, a piano player, an architect, and a couple anarchist hitchhiker girls.",male
mara,what type of things did you talk about,female
vincent,"all types of stuff.  the hottest topic seems to be ""what other Craigslist rides have you taken?""",male
vincent,"and ""what are the weirdest people you've ever ridden with?""",male
mara,"oh man, have you ever done it before?",female
vincent,"yeah, I've done it a pretty good amoung of times.",male
vincent,where did shelly and ariel go?,male
mara,what happens with music on those trips?!,female
mara,no idea... lol,female
vincent,"It's funny, people always seem hesitant to play music for a car full of strangers.  But then after a long time, the conversation dies down a little and someone puts something on.",male
vincent,"there's this weird thing where everyone is like, ""yeah, I'm up for listening to anything at all"" but then no one volunteers anything.",male
mara,did you guys have same music preferences,female
mara,this is kinda boring with two people huh?,female
vincent,"I have pretty broad music love, so I really can roll with (almost) everything.  The Spanish teacher dude played some pretty cheesy musical-theater sounding jazz.",male
vincent,Yeah!,male
vincent,it's weird in here.,male
mara,they should regulate this crap more... people need to show up!!,female
vincent,shelly??,male
vincent,"wait, you have to go at what time?",male
mara,thats soooo funny!,female
vincent,what's funny?,male
mara,like 1240 or so...,female
mara,the spanish teachers cheesy music,female
vincent,"whoa, I'm going to be in monologue mode for a little bit.",male
mara,yeah i guess so,female
vincent,"yeah, that was a little questionable, but it didn't ruin the trip or anything.",male
mara,do your chate room users keep going blank?,female
vincent,"No, it still shows shelly and ariel as signed in.",male
mara,mine has no one at all,female
vincent,she says we should sign out and then restart the server.,male
vincent,I mean just sign back in.,male
mara,so what should we talk about?,female
mara,what kind of beer your drink?,female
vincent,hello?,male
mara,ok leave! and comeback,female
vincent,hi!,male
vincent,again.,male
vincent,it looksl ike I'm the only one signed up,male
mara,no lol just once,female
vincent,I'm back.,male
mara,this is weird... errors in the chat i guess,female
mara,yay... ariel? are you with us?,female
ariel,"Yes, I think so FINALLY",female
ariel,so what are we discussing,female
ariel,"sorry, having mucho computer problems",female
mara,we are discussing how boring this was without you haha,female
vincent,we were discussing how it was weird that you guys disappeared.,male
vincent,ha,male
mara,haha vincent!,female
ariel,Well thanks :),female
mara,what would you like to talk about?,female
mara,lets talk about food.. im starving!,female
ariel,I don't know,female
shelly,Woot. It works now.,female
mara,what do people like to eat?,female
ariel,pizza,female
vincent,nice.,male
mara,yay shelly! very ahppy you are with us,female
mara,pizza? what kinds?,female
mara,fav. toppings?,female
shelly,"I used the time I couldn't log on to warm up some pasta, bacon, broc, and cheese sauce. That was yummy.",female
shelly,Wish I had more.,female
mara,left overs?,female
ariel,"cheese, i am a vegetarian so i dont eat meat and i am not a huge fan of veggies on my pizza",female
vincent,I'm veggie too!,male
mara,yeah i get that... i love tofu,female
ariel,Nice,female
shelly,"Pizza: broc, olives, sausage, onions",female
vincent,how long?,male
shelly,Tofu isn't a food. It's a texture in search of a flavor.,female
vincent,"I mean, how long have you been vegetarian?",male
ariel,"i do eat vegetables just not on my pizza, I have been a veggie for about twelve years now",female
mara,eww i like chicken bacon ranch with no pizza sauce haha,female
ariel,"wow, just realizing this",female
vincent,me too about 12 years.,male
vincent,"13, I guess.",male
ariel,"oh wow, funny",female
vincent,"no pizza sauce, mara?",male
ariel,i've been since summer after senior year of college,female
ariel,or i mean high school,female
shelly,"Given what I know about how meat is prepared in this country, I wish I could be a vegetarian. But I really crave meat. Specially bacon.",female
mara,no i hate tomato sauce... really weird i cant do it but i will eat tomatos just like apples,female
vincent,wow!  so in general you're not down with Italian food?,male
mara,yeah my boyfriend and his family have a farm so i get all the meat in the world! couldnt stop myself from eatting it haha,female
shelly,"My wife adores tomato sauce. If I stopped eating, I'm sure she would leave me. ""I just don't know you anymore."" <gin>",female
ariel,I LOVE TOMATO SAUCE,female
mara,"i like some of it, but it needs to be prepared plain hha",female
ariel,but hate tomatoes,female
vincent,me too.,male
shelly,That's the way to go. Know where your meat comes from. I should probably look into local farms and meat production.,female
vincent,"3 favorite types of food (not in order): Thai, Italian, Mexican",male
mara,do you guys eat fish?,female
ariel,"yes, you can always buy local at farmer's markets",female
ariel,then you can talk to the dude who prepares your meat,female
ariel,no fish either,female
shelly,"I go with: Sushi, Pasta, Bacon",female
mara,yes you should shelly... local is the way to go!,female
vincent,"I don't eat fish, but I ate fish the summer that I worked on a fishing boat.",male
ariel,"italian, italian and italian?",female
ariel,hahaha,female
vincent,nice.,male
mara,you talked about that before... so strictly no meat at all!?,female
mara,"mexican, chinese, tuna!",female
mara,haha,female
shelly,"We eat fish regularly, and not just as sushi. My son will eat it and there's not that much he likes. Stupid picky teenagers. <gin>",female
mara,what about eggs?,female
vincent,"no meat at all, except fake meat sometimes.",male
ariel,"well yes, absolutely no mean for me at all but i do eat and drink dairy",female
ariel,yes eggs,female
ariel,i like to bake too much,female
mara,veggie burgers?,female
vincent,"I do eat eggs, but mostly as ingredients in other things.  like bannana bread.",male
ariel,oh yeah i eat fake meat too,female
ariel,yeah veggie burgers,female
mara,i like veggie burgers!,female
ariel,i try to get free range eggs though,female
shelly,"I used to eat eggs when I was young, but I don't have a taste for them anymore. Except as part of an omlet or mixed with liberal doses of cheese. Then again, anything with liberal doses of cheese works for me.",female
vincent,"egg production, and lots of how dairy is made, is pretty dark.  but I haven't been able to stop.",male
vincent,cheese is one of my favorite things.,male
ariel,"i do my best to choose the best products out there, what i can afford",female
mara,well my bfs fam has a dairy farm,female
vincent,that's where the Italian and Mexican score high.,male
shelly,"I tried veggie burgers, but my expectation to taste real burger got in the way. If I eat veggie, which I do now and again, I don't want anything that's meat posing.",female
ariel,when i am working again i will probably do even better,female
vincent,"no fake hot dogs, shelly?",male
mara,i guess i compare it to hollywood taking advantage of us and our interests to make money...farming takes advantage of cows and what they can produce to make money but at the same time feeding the whole world!,female
ariel,"hahahaha, my family thinks i am crazy for eating meat substitutes, they say my tastes buds are scewed",female
shelly,"True, true about eggs. Or poultry for that matter. Pretty gruesome all in all.",female
mara,"yes  chicken is another story, i do agree",female
vincent,not the whole world... mostly the First World.,male
shelly,"A fake hot dog is easier to handle. The spices in hot dogs are so strong that the meat taste isn't always so noticable even in a real one. Besides with relish, catsup, and saurkraut, who knows there's a dog in there. ;)",female
ariel,i suppose you could talk yourself out of eating anything really,female
mara,ohman do you watch fear factor?,female
vincent,"yeah, and no matter how gross the idea of ""fake"" is, the reality of a real hot dog is so gross!",male
shelly,Nope.,female
mara,they have to eat the nastiest stuff on that show!,female
ariel,"in Toronto, they sell veggie dogs at hot dog stands on the side of the street, it is the craziest thing",female
shelly,"Yah, ""real"" hot dogs are not something you want to think about too much.",female
ariel,they are a lot more vegetarian friendly around those parts,female
mara,gotta love CANADA!,female
ariel,just visited there,female
vincent,we have veggie dog vendors in Seattle.,male
shelly,Probably less meat to go around. We are spoiled in teh States.,female
mara,shelly you should check out fear factor sometime... soooooo funnt what people so or money,female
ariel,"Yeah east coasters think that vegetarians are weird, hahahaha unless you live in maine",female
vincent,"ariel, you just visited Seattle?",male
ariel,no Toronto,female
vincent,"Ithaca, NY is veggie paradise.  pretty close to you guys.",male
mara,eting bull testicles! and stuff!  GROSS,female
vincent,ahhhhhhhhhh!,male
shelly,I actually watch a bunch of TV. I like scripted stuff though. Seeing how low people will go just feeds into my cynical side. I'm cynical enough in my old age.,female
mara,hahaha,female
ariel,fear factor freaks me out,female
mara,yeah me too! i would have a heart attack doing those things,female
ariel,"i have always meant to visit Ithaca, i hear it is a pretty cool town",female
vincent,"yeah, I lived there for a long time.  go in the summer: swimming in waterfalls!",male
shelly,"It's gorge-ous. Sorry, had to do it.",female
vincent,ha.,male
vincent,and Ithaca has its own currency.,male
shelly,Huh?,female
mara,and they know how to drink!,female
ariel,hahahaha gorge-ous hahahaha,female
vincent,"they have local money that's not backed by the federal gov't.  it pays at a better rate, and you can use it at all the local businesses.",male
ariel,maybe this summer,female
vincent,it's called Ithaca Hours.,male
ariel,"i have decided recently to stop putting off stuff i want to do, but rather just do it",female
shelly,Who created this money? Is it backed by a local bank or something?,female
vincent,"It's backed by some kind of local money, I don't remember the exact details, but it's pretty interesting and cool.",male
mara,lol,female
vincent,"If you work in town, you can choose to get paid in a split of US$ and Ithaca Hours.",male
ariel,interesting i have never heard of this,female
ariel,how recent is this,female
shelly,We looked at Ithaca several years back because they have a community-supported farm complex and development that's seriously green. Very cool stuff.,female
ariel,i had a friend who went to Cornell and he never mentioned,female
mara,my bf with the farm studied at cornell university,female
mara,very prestigious thats for sure,female
vincent,"it's existed since the 80s, I think.  and it's based on a living wage, like one hour of work = one ""Hour"", which I think is like $10.",male
ariel,yeah he went for veterinarian medicine,female
ariel,now he is a animal pathologist,female
mara,thats amazing really,female
shelly,"They treat their own water and sewage via a swamp and do heavy recycle/reuse stuff. You buy into the community like a condo and join the political strucuture and everything. A bit too hippy for us, but the core principals are pretty attractive.",female
ariel,well now i really have to go and check this place out,female
vincent,found this: link,male
ariel,well as long as you are allowed to leave...,female
ariel,:),female
mara,do you guys have pets?,female
shelly,"I guess if don't refuse to take $, having an alternative currency wouldn't be illegal. Interesting if there's been any legal challenges or if the feds are unhappy about it.",female
vincent,"not sure, I wonder.",male
vincent,"I have a dog and a cat living at my house, but neither of them are ""mine""",male
ariel,hhhhmmm be interesting to investigate,female
ariel,i have two cats,female
ariel,and a bunch of fish,female
mara,haha funn,female
shelly,My family wants a cat but I'm allergic. It's a black mark against me for sure. ;),female
mara,i have a 125lb dog and a little rescue dog about 40 lbs,female
vincent,"The dog is a black pug named Bugbear, the cat is called Professor Enchiladas.",male
mara,im allergic to cats too! and they scare the shit out of me,female
shelly,That's a big dog.,female
vincent,what are your pet names?,male
ariel,they scare you?,female
vincent,scared of cats?,male
mara,i have Keller the big one and Jesse the smalll on,female
ariel,"Chloe and Otis, i don't name my fish because i find they die when you do",female
mara,yes very scared ive been attacked before by my neighbors cata,female
shelly,"lol, so what's a person called who's scared of cats, a scaredy cat of cats?",female
mara,and they are soooo sneaky the way they walk and look at you,female
vincent,ha.,male
mara,i just cant do it!,female
ariel,"cats can be nasty,  Otis is a freak",female
ariel,"i don't like her, but she is actually my sister's cat so that is ok",female
vincent,"yeah, it's definitely a different way of ""communicating"" then dogs.",male
vincent,it's subtle.,male
ariel,"Chloe is a rescue cat and she seems to understand this, the most lovable cat ever",female
vincent,"I grew up with dogs as a kid, so cats are pretty new, but my girlfriend has 3, so I'm learning.  I'm getting pretty good at reading them.",male
mara,yeah and my friend was like cats  just dont ever attack just to attack haha and then she went up to my friends cat sitting on the fireplace and it swatted at her and made her bleed,female
mara,i laughed in her face sooo hard lol,female
shelly,"I always remember a comic I read where a guy walks past a cat and says, as an aside, ""don't worry, I won't reveal your overlords plan to rule the universe."" The next panel shows the cat saying ""whew."" It had nothing to do with the story, it was just a quick aside.",female
vincent,ha,male
ariel,hahahaha,female
ariel,"here's a question, has any one ever heard of a band named Enter the Haggis",female
shelly,Definitely. Great irish rock.,female
vincent,"watch out for twitching cat tail.  that usuall means, I'm annoyed and want to be left alone.",male
ariel,"Nice, you know them",female
vincent,never heard them.,male
ariel,where are you from shelly,female
ariel,you should totally check them out : enterthehaggis.com,female
vincent,"cool, I will.",male
ariel,"they are more then just Irish rock, and they just came out with a new cd",female
vincent,I always think of the Pogues when I think of Irish rock.,male
mara,nope never heard,female
shelly,"Celtic Cross, Atlan, Gaelic Storm, Killadares are similar and great as well.",female
ariel,the cool thing about their site is that you can listen to all their music for free,female
shelly,"Pogues too, yep.",female
mara,that is cool,female
ariel,"yes, they can be pogueish and a bit like Kildares",female
ariel,they are a bit less traditional then some celtic rock bands,female
shelly,I grew up in NJ but have lived in Albany for decades. Got into Irish/Scotish/Gaelic music a while back. We have an Irish festival here every year and I go and pick up five or six CDs of the various bands.,female
vincent,I guess the Pogues are like the entry-level Irish punk band... the one everyone has heard of.,male
ariel,"they have changed, i dont' know if that is necessarily a good thing or not",female
shelly,I think the Pogues are the hardest rock of the bunch.,female
ariel,"oh yeah, I2K",female
ariel,i live near albany too,female
shelly,"Maybe that's easier to take than fiddles, accordians, and bagpipes. ;)",female
ariel,"yeah, pogues are pretty hard",female
ariel,"hahaha, yeah",female
mara,haha that doesnt saound to easy thats for sure,female
ariel,"i like that added twist though, celtic rock is probably my favorite music",female
ariel,enter the haggis has only bagpipes and fiddle,female
ariel,no accordian,female
shelly,"Kaiser Chiefs, Orleans, and something called British Sea Power are pretty good too. Love the last groups name. Pretencious, no?",female
vincent,"my current favorite music is 60s and 70s Soul... but I love hip-hop, indie rock, metal, experimental music",male
ariel,"hahahaha, yeah a bit",female
ariel,"but i'll to check those groups out, never heard of any of them",female
mara,i cant play any instruements? can you guys?,female
vincent,I'm a drummer.,male
ariel,"i can sort of play baritone horn, trumpet and piano",female
ariel,but only basics,female
mara,"right vincent, i knew that about you and your band",female
mara,sort of?,female
ariel,what is your bands name vincent?,female
mara,are you being modest? haah,female
vincent,oh yeah.,male
vincent,it's called The Dead Science.,male
vincent,"I play with some other bands, too, but that's my main one.",male
ariel,"naw, not really, i can play them because i did it in high school but i am a bit rusty",female
ariel,:),female
vincent,I played baritone as a kid.,male
ariel,do you have a website,female
ariel,or myspace,female
vincent,"yeah, we mostly use the myspace as our website.",male
shelly,"I was a drummer in my youth. Got back into it recently when my son got Rock Band 2. It's pretty fun. The game doesn't simulate drumming exactly, but it's much closer than the guitar playing. You work up a sweat.",female
ariel,i'll have to check you out,female
vincent,"cool!  we're touring in June, but I'm not sure if we're playing the Albany area.",male
ariel,i wish i played a rock band type instrument,female
vincent,we're playing Brooklyn and NY for sure.,male
shelly,"Cool, browsing over to it right now.",female
ariel,wow cool,female
vincent,"I haven't tried rock band yet, sounds really fun.",male
shelly,Which one in the picture is you vincent?,female
vincent,I'll have to check.,male
ariel,always willing to try new music,female
shelly,Make Mine Marvel eh? That a comic reference?,female
vincent,on the right.,male
vincent,"yep, MMM, of course.",male
shelly,Good stuff. You sell on iTunes?,female
vincent,my chat thing just started acting weird.,male
vincent,better now.,male
vincent,"yeah, we're on itunes.",male
mara,does that every now and then,female
shelly,"Wow, you been going at this since 2003? You stud! That's a hard biz.",female
ariel,wow that is impressive,female
ariel,is it your only job?,female
vincent,"I haven't been in the band the whole time, but I have since 2005.  been playing music forever, though.",male
vincent,"I wouldn't call it a ""job,"" but it's what I spend the most time in my life doing...",male
shelly,"LOL. Like my game design work. I love it, but a ""job"" indicates some reasonable level of pay, and that just ain't part of the gig.",female
ariel,"well yeah i see your point, i know the guys from Enter the Haggis, tour enough that that is all they do for money",female
shelly,"Cool, are the Haggis guys serious rock and rollers, or just regular guys?",female
ariel,oh they are totally just regular guys,female
ariel,they drive a van with a trailer instead of a bus,female
shelly,Nice.,female
mara,well everyone i have to go... its been just over an hour and i have a meeting at 1pm so i feel its ok to leave now,female
ariel,they always come out and talk to their fans after the shows,female
ariel,wicked wicked nice,female
mara,and ill tty all soon,female
ariel,and well super cute too,female
shelly,Bye mara. See ya next time.,female
ariel,hahahaha,female
vincent,"thanks for keeping me company earlier, mara!",male
shelly,lol,female
ariel,bye mara,female
mara,no problem,female
mara,bye all!,female
vincent,"damn, I have to see pictures of these guys now!",male
ariel,i actually do a bit of work for them,female
ariel,typing up email lists they collect at shows,female
ariel,keeps them up to date,female
shelly,"Okay, what's next?",female
ariel,because they tend to fall behind on the small stuff,female
ariel,"hahaha yeah yeah, go check em",female
ariel,out,female
ariel,how did you find out about this research?,female
vincent,I like the dyed hair guy.,male
ariel,yeah he tends to be everyone's favorite,female
vincent,he's the cutest.,male
ariel,i like the other guitar player with glasses,female
vincent,curly hair?,male
ariel,"hahaha, no, he is the bass player",female
ariel,he is cute too though but married,female
ariel,the other one with glasses,female
vincent,ouch.,male
ariel,what ouch?,female
ariel,that he is married,female
vincent,married.,male
vincent,do you think you have a shot at the guitar guy?,male
ariel,oh man i wish,female
ariel,but no,female
vincent,go for it!,male
ariel,well it is hard because they travel so much and i think he has a girlfriend,female
shelly,Not a love-em and leave-em guy?,female
ariel,and well you know they are from Toronto,female
ariel,no i don't think so,female
ariel,very sweet actually,female
shelly,I did not know that.,female
vincent,ha.,male
shelly,So how do you get the email lists? They send them to you or just give them to you when they get home?,female
ariel,"yeah, they're Canadian eh",female
vincent,ha,male
ariel,"when i see them at shows, i pick up what they have",female
ariel,i go see them a ton,female
vincent,so they come around albany a lot?,male
ariel,well they play the Northeast a lot,female
shelly,"Sounds like my wife and They Might Be Giants. She loves them and sees them whenever they are in the area, or even close to the area. She's a fanatic.",female
ariel,and i do travel a bit to see them,female
ariel,yes shelly you could definitely call me a fanatic,female
vincent,they might be giants are super fun to see.,male
ariel,i have always wanted to see the,female
ariel,them,female
shelly,And TMBG have been at since the 80s. Yikes!,female
ariel,"hahahahaha, yeah i am wondering how long i will continue to go see these guys",female
ariel,i think as long as they stay together,female
ariel,i hope they are in it for the long hall,female
vincent,"for me TMBG were totally amazing the first time, then it gets a little less exciting as you get used to their ""thing""",male
ariel,i just became a fan back in 2006,female
shelly,Have you noticed a change in their music at all in the time you've been following them?,female
shelly,Have they evolved or changed?,female
shelly,That's always interesting to me. Has that happened to your band vincent?,female
ariel,"yeah, they are a little bit less traditional, which is ok, but i tend to like the traditional tunes they do best",female
vincent,"yeah, we've changed a lot from recording to recording.  and we're all secretly jazz-playing guys, so the songs always sort of change in the details, like subtle improvisations and stuff",male
shelly,"Just remembered: Great Big Sea is a great, great, celtic-oriented Canadian band. They have a really fun show.",female
ariel,i think they started off traditional because this is what got them into festivals in the celtic circuit and now they are trying to change things up a bit,female
ariel,i hope they do not go to far off this route or they might not keep their celtic rock fan base and then that could be bad,female
shelly,Interesting vincent. I didn't detect much jazz in the music in my space. Why don't you push that aspect more?,female
ariel,"hahaha, funny you should mention jazz, the bass player and drummer of ETH are originally jazz musicians and i think you can sense this sometimes",female
vincent,"it comes out more live, and more in maybe the older stuff (the white record with the trees on the cover)... it shows up mostly in the weird chords in the guitar stuff.",male
shelly,Listening to The Litter and the Leaves right now. Great stuff.,female
vincent,"and the looseness of the drums, I get to play stuff different every time.",male
ariel,"hahahahaha, ah yes that is a favorite of the new album",female
ariel,people keep mentioning it,female
shelly,"Always gotta mash up the rhythms. Otherwise, it gets boring, no?",female
vincent,right.,male
ariel,got to keep things interesting,female
shelly,You know a band is tight if the drummer can mess with the rhythm and the other players follow along and the music stays good.,female
ariel,especially when you do a lot of touring i would say,female
vincent,"yeah, that's my favorite thing.",male
vincent,to do and to hear.,male
shelly,How long are your shows usually vincent?,female
vincent,"we don't usually play super long, 40 minutes?",male
vincent,"unless we're the only band of the night, which usually doesn't happn on tour.",male
shelly,"Do you have a standard play list on a tour, or do you mix it up every night?",female
ariel,do you get air time on the radio?,female
vincent,we switch it up a lot.  pretty much only college radio and indie stuff.,male
vincent,we have a little better luck with radio in Europe.,male
vincent,the radio isn't such a music-industry insitution over there... people play what they want.,male
ariel,that is cool,female
shelly,I was a college DJ. I loved playing weirdass stuff nobody ever heard of. I would play things if I thought the album cover was cool (dating myself here).,female
ariel,i wonder if ETH has looked into that,female
vincent,"yeah, college radio is really special.  you can hear some stuff you wouldn't hear anywhere else.",male
shelly,"Higher ups always tried to give me a playlist. I ignored them. Wasn't ""employee of hte month"" much. ;)",female
ariel,i always liked listening to cool stuff on college radio,female
vincent,"as DJ's even, like, whoa, what's this?  let's play it?",male
ariel,"they are the up and coming fans, get them interested and who knows what will happen",female
shelly,We have a station around here that run by AMC (public radio) at 97.7. They are like a college station but even more eclectic. They are on teh web too. Exit 97.7 I think.,female
vincent,totally.,male
ariel,i would have loved being a DJ except i think i would have been too shy,female
ariel,but getting to play all sorts of cool music,female
vincent,whoa!  chat freakout!!!!,male
ariel,would have been fun,female
vincent,my screen went nuts,male
vincent,"you could have done the ""all music, no talking"" hour!",male
ariel,yeah every once and a while i get the chat in clumps,female
shelly,They've discovered us. Gak! Hide the stuff!,female
ariel,"true, if only i had thought of that now",female
ariel,then,female
vincent,I don't know shelly and ariel!,male
